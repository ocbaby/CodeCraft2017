## Introduction：
    This is my algorithm idea to solve the problem with an iterator based on minimized-cost flow algorithm.
    Save your workspace first to avoid lossing important data! ! !
    Put files under current folder.
    Directly run the file run in matlab.
    If nothing is wrong, the result of the test case can be displayed in about 0.2s.

## Function of files:
    >short.m : Find the shortest path.
    >MCF.m : Find the minimized-cost flow.
    >construct.m : Set super nodes and format the matrixes.
    >cvt.m : Convert the result, a flow matrix, to official format.
    >climb.m : Recursively sparsify the flow matrix into routes.
    >cdn.m : The iterator.(Some strategies may under discussion.)
    >run.m : Execute.
    >test1.mat : Test case.
    >README.md : The file you're reading.
